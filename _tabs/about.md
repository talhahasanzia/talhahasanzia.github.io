ℹ️ I'm Talha, a programmer who is adding bugs in code on daily basis, I like to work on tooling, checkout my [github](https://github.com/talhahasanzia) to see some of my failed experiments. I mainly do Android Native, and a bit of everything else which can solve a problem or improve developer experience.

💻 I have extensively worked in CI/CD on multiple mobile platforms, where app is getting published on Play/App Store with one simple trigger. I love to solve such problems where all the complexities are hidden from user (or developer).

🔍 I do all my work using ChatGPT and Github Co-pilot (no shame in that).

🤝 Connect with me on socials if you are passionate about simplicity in user experience, developer experience, tooling, automation, CI/CD, data visualization and gaming.

 🍉 I also believe, from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.  🍉
